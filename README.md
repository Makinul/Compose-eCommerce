# Product Listing App

This Android application displays a paginated list of products fetched from a remote API. It features infinite scrolling, a polished and responsive user interface, and incorporates several advanced Android development techniques.

## Features

* **Paginated Product List:** Displays products in manageable chunks fetched from the API.
* **Infinite Scrolling:** Automatically loads the next page of products as the user scrolls down, providing a seamless browsing experience.
* **Clean and Responsive UI:** Utilizes modern Android UI components and layout techniques to ensure a visually appealing and adaptable interface across various screen sizes and orientations.
* **Error Handling:** Gracefully handles network errors and displays informative messages to the user.
* **Loading Indicators:** Provides visual feedback to the user during data fetching operations.
* **[Optional: Add any other specific advanced features implemented, e.g., Pull-to-refresh, Offline caching, Search functionality, Filtering/Sorting, Detailed product view, Animations, Unit/UI Tests]**

## Technologies Used

* **Kotlin:** The primary programming language for Android development.
* **Android Jetpack Libraries:**
    * **ViewModel:** For managing UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
    * **LiveData:** For observable data that is lifecycle-aware.
    * **RecyclerView:** For efficiently displaying large lists of data.
    * **Paging 3 Library:** For simplifying the implementation of paginated data loading and infinite scrolling.
    * **[Optional: Add other Jetpack libraries used, e.g., Room Persistence Library, Navigation Component, Data Binding]**
* **Retrofit:** A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
* **Coroutines:** For managing background tasks and asynchronous operations in a more concise and readable way.
* **[Optional: Add other third-party libraries used, e.g., Coil/Glide for image loading, Dagger/Hilt for dependency injection, Moshi/Gson for JSON parsing]**
* **[Optional: Mention any specific architectural patterns used, e.g., MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)]**

## Architecture

The application follows a [mention architectural pattern if used, e.g., Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)] architecture to ensure separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability.

* **UI Layer (Activities/Fragments):** Responsible for displaying data to the user and handling user interactions.
* **ViewModel Layer:** Holds UI-related data and handles business logic, independent of the UI lifecycle.
* **Data Layer (Repositories, Data Sources, Network API):** Responsible for fetching and managing data from various sources, including the remote API.

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    ```
2.  **Open the project in Android Studio.**
3.  **[Optional: If API key is required] Configure API Key:**
    * Locate the `local.properties` file in the project's root directory.
    * Add the API key as follows:
        ```
        API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
        ```
    * [Alternatively, if the API key is managed differently, provide those instructions.]
4.  **Build and run the application on an Android emulator or a physical device.**

## API Information

* **API Endpoint:** `[Provide the base URL of the API]`
* **Pagination Endpoint:** `[Provide the specific endpoint for fetching paginated products, including any required parameters like page number or page size]`
* **Request Method:** `[Specify the HTTP method used, e.g., GET]`
* **[Optional: Describe the structure of the API response, especially the product data and pagination information.]**

## Advanced Features Implementation Details

* **Infinite Scrolling (Paging 3):** The `androidx.paging:paging-runtime-ktx` library is used to efficiently load and display paginated data. A `Pager` is configured with a `PagingSource` that handles fetching data from the API for each page. An `AsyncPagingDataDiffer` is used in the `RecyclerView.Adapter` to handle the presentation of the `PagingData`.
* **UI Responsiveness:** Layouts are designed using `ConstraintLayout` or other flexible layout managers to adapt to different screen sizes. `RecyclerView` is used for efficient list rendering.
* **Error Handling:** Network requests are wrapped in try-catch blocks to handle potential exceptions. `LiveData` is used to observe the loading state and error messages, which are then displayed to the user.
* **Loading Indicators:** A `ProgressBar` or similar UI element is displayed while data is being fetched, and its visibility is controlled by the loading state exposed through `LiveData`.
* **[Optional: Elaborate on the implementation details of other advanced features mentioned in the Features section.]**

## Future Enhancements

* Implement pull-to-refresh functionality.
* Add offline caching using a local database (e.g., Room).
* Implement search and filtering options for products.
* Create a detailed view for individual products.
* Add UI animations for a smoother user experience.
* Write unit and UI tests to ensure code quality and stability.
